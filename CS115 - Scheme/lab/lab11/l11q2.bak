;; A general tree (gen-tree) is either
;;      a string or
;;      a structure (make-t-node l c), where
;;           l is a string and
;;           c is a tree-list.

;; A tree-list is either
;;      (cons t empty), where
;;           t is a gen-tree or      
;;      (cons t tlist), where
;;           t is a gen-tree and
;;           tlist is a tree-list.
