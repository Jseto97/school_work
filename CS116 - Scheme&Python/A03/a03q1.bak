(define-struct trans (action amount))
;; A trans is a structure (make-trans a amt), 
;; that represents a transaction for a bank account, where
;; a is a symbol, either 'deposit or 'withdraw. A deposit is a 
;; payment made into the account. A withdrawal is a payment 
;; made out of the account.
;; amt is a positive number representing the amount added
;; or removed from the account.

;;For Testing 
;;You may add as necessary
(define trans1 (make-trans 'withdraw 604.34))
(define trans2 (make-trans 'deposit 300))
(define trans3 (make-trans 'withdraw 20.99))
(define trans4 (make-trans 'deposit 60)) 
(define trans5 (make-trans 'deposit 900))
(define trans6 (make-trans 'withdraw 55.5))
(define trans7 (make-trans 'deposit 100))
(define trans8 (make-trans 'deposit 40))
